# Scripts for assessing a fixed income security

## The following tools will be made to evaluate a fixed income security as practice for my CFA materials

### (Consolidation may occur in the future and the following list is not exhaustive)

* Calculate horizon yield (the IRR of total return for holding period)
* Calculating various convexity and duration statistics
* Potentially develop a model to empirically determine duration, maybe with deep learning

As of now, bond.py can calculate the YTM and PV of a bond and visualize the constant-yield price trajectory for that bond.
In the future, bond.py may be broken up into several scripts, one of which initializes the bond object and the others perform calculations. Over the long term, bond.py or whatever it looks like in the future will be compatible with the portfolio script in my other repository.
